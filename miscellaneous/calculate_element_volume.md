### **Calculate Element Volume**  

---

## 📝 **Description**  
The **Calculate Element Volume** script calculates the total volume of selected elements in Autodesk Revit. It processes the geometry of each selected element, sums up the volumes of valid 3D solids, and outputs the result in cubic meters. This script is particularly useful for quantity takeoffs, volume analysis, and estimating material requirements.

## 🛠️ **Usage Instructions**  

1. **Select Elements** – Highlight one or more elements in the Revit model.  
2. **Run the Script** –  
   - Open the **BIMO Add-in** tab.  
   - Click **Run Python** and select the **Calculate Element Volume** script.  
3. **View Results** –  
   - The volumes for the selected elements will be displayed in cubic meters.  
   - Errors (if any) for invalid elements will also be displayed.  

---

## ⚙️ **Requirements**  

- Autodesk Revit with the **BIMO Add-in** installed.  
- Elements must have valid 3D geometry (e.g., Family Instances with solids).  
- Revit API compatibility (tested with Python scripts executed through BIMO).  

---

## 📋 **Output**  

- A list of volumes in cubic meters for each selected element.  
- Error messages for elements without valid geometry or unsupported types.  

---

## 💡 **Example Use Case**  

- **Material Estimation** – Calculate the volume of concrete columns or beams for cost estimation.  
- **Quality Checks** – Verify that modeled volumes match design specifications.  
- **BIM Analysis** – Generate data for clash detection or construction planning.

## 🔧 **Script Configuration**  

### Input:  
- **Selected Elements** – User-selected elements within the Revit model.  

### Processing:  
- Extracts the geometry of each element.  
- Identifies solids and sums up their volumes.  
- Converts the volume from cubic feet (Revit default) to cubic meters.  

### Output:  
- Displays a list of volumes or error messages for invalid elements.

## ⚠️ **Notes**  

- Elements without valid geometry (e.g., annotations or empty families) are ignored, and errors are logged.  
- Ensure the selected elements are modeled correctly and contain 3D solids for accurate calculations.  
- The script does not account for openings, voids, or complex geometry transformations.
